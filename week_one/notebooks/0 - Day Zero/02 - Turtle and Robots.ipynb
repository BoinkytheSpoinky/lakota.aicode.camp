    "\n",
    "**Session Goals:**\n",
    "1.  Meet the Python Turtle! Learn how to make it draw on your screen.\n",
    "2.  Control your turtle's movements: forward, backward, left, and right.\n",
    "3.  Learn to lift the turtle's pen up and put it down.\n",
    "4.  Change your turtle's color and pen size.\n",
    "5.  Draw your first shapes and prepare for your Turtle homework!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Reminder:**\n",
    "*   We'll write our Turtle code in **Python scripts** (files ending with `.py`) using VS Code/Cursor.\n",
    "*   Create a new file (e.g., `my_first_turtle_drawing.py`).\n",
    "*   Type the Python code from the examples below into that file.\n",
    "*   Run your script from the VS Code/Cursor terminal: `python your_file_name.py`\n",
    "*   A new window should pop up with your Turtle drawing!"
