# Design your own turtle design!

You must give your turtle at least 75 commands, and try to make something cool! These commands can be placed in a loop or done however you'd like, but the turtle MUST RECEIVE at least 75 of them.

For tomorrow, you must have a jupyter notebook with your answer.

For this exercise, stick to the following commands.

t.forward(X): Move forward X units
t.right(X): Turn right X degrees
t.left(X): Turn left X degrees
